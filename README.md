# Muabdib Chess Engine

Muabdib Chess Engine is an open-source chess engine written in Go. This is my side project. The engine does not aspire to be the fastest (I should have chosen another language for that) or the strongest, but it aims to be a fast Go implementation (I plan to use some x86 assembly).

Muabdib uses a bitboard chess representation.

The project is in a very early stage. So far, only the chess movement rules have been implemented. Its correctness has been validated using Stockfish's perft.
